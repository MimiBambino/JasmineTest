# Project Overview

This project was created for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program as project 6.  I wrote tests using the Jasmine testing framework.

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.  
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.  
3. You should see a feed reader web application and at the bottom of the page there will be a section labeled "Jasmine 2.1.2".
4. Under this heading you should see 13 specs, 0 failures.  
5. In order to view the actual tests, open the JasmineTest/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file in a text editor.
